# Splits input B-Format audio and splits into a number of segments of specified
# segment length. Takes a list of files as input - these can be of any number of
# channels as long as there are four channels in total (e.g. 2 x stereo files,
# 4 x mono files, or a single B-Format file). Audio is resampled to a specified
#Â sample rate (44100 default) before segmentation. Trims a length of time from
# the start and end of input files to avoid sounds made by the sound recordist.
# This is 20 seconds by default, but can be disabled by setting segment_length
# to 0.
#
# In the future this could be expanded to segment n-channel audio (e.g. for use
# with eigenmike recordings).
