Z_0 = 413.3 # characteristic acoustic impedance of air
rho_0 = 1.2041 # density of air
c = 343.21 # speed of sound

# filt_audio is indexed [ time : freq : channels ]
u = -(1 / (Z_0 * np.sqrt(2))) * filt_audio[:,10,1:].T # u = particle velocity (XYZ)
p = filt_audio[:,10,0] # p = sound pressure (W)

# I = instantaneous sound field intensity
I = p * u # this will give an array with I at each sample point

# E = instantaneous sound field energy
E = 0.5 * rho_0 * ( (p**2 / Z_0**2) + (np.linalg.norm(u, axis=0)**2) )
# this calculates E for each sample point - works accross all


# for parity with the way librosa calculates MFCCs:
# librosa.util.frame(np.pad(E, int(n_fft // 2), 'reflect')
# n_fft = 2048 by default - will have to incorporate a way to make this track
# whatever values happen to be being used for the MFCC calculation
# **** It's worth noting that this is essentially actually adding minute
# extra amounts of time to the beginning and ending of the analysis - since
# we're in the time domain this might be an issue ****

#Â with MFCC calculation

#                         for I_slice in np.split(I, len(E)/t_samples, axis=1)])
#
# # likewise for E
# E_means = np.array([E_slice.mean()
#                         for E_slice in np.split(E, len(E)/t_samples)])

# it would probably be possible to use matrix multiplication to calculate all
